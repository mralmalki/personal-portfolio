                <h3>Project Description:</h3>
                <p>MID Project Management was a project that I completed with my team during spring 2023. It aims to
                    help teams assign, track and manage tasks, as well as monitor project progress through reporting and
                    analytics. It includes features such as task assignment and tracking, time tracking, and reporting
                    and analytics. The architecture style chosen is a microservices architecture, which allows for
                    the development of independent services that can communicate with each other through APIs, providing
                    greater scalability and flexibility. The design patterns used include the observer pattern to notify
                    team members of updates to tasks, the factory pattern to create different types of tasks or reports,
                    and the command pattern to implement undo and redo functionality.
                </p>

                <h3>Role:</h3>
                <p>
                    In the course of the project, my primary focus was on the employer and employee portal as well as
                    about pages. However, upon returning to work on the skill functionality, I ended up working on all
                    aspects of the project, such as the home and view tasks pages.
                </p>
                <p>I assumed the position of an unofficial leader among the team members in my group. My aim was to assist
                    the team in maintaining order and assigning tasks that required completion.

                <h3>What I learned:</h3>
                <p>Throughout the process, I acquired a wealth of valuable knowledge and expertise. Although I had no
                    prior experience in JavaScript, my familiarity with Java allowed me to quickly learn it.
                    Additionally, I gained hands-on experience in developing websites with both front-end and back-end
                    capabilities using NodeJS, which was an innovative and intriguing approach to web development.
                    Furthermore, I was introduced to NextJS and React, which proved to be highly effective tools in
                    designing site components, and TailwindCSS, which was both novel and practical. With access to all
                    of these resources, I felt more imaginative and, overall, they facilitated the creation of a
                    superior end product.
